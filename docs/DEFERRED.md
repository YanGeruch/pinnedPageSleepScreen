- WP1: unverified — chapter chrome rects come from `mapToItem(DocumentView root)`
  (`src/pinnedPageSleepScreen.qmd:358-372`) while `complement()` clips against the
  sleep window's `root.width/height` (physical portrait, 954x1696 fallback at
  `:1147-1148`). If DocumentView's root is logical-landscape in landscape, the
  chapter holes are computed on swapped axes for exactly the captures WP1 now
  rotates the bar for. Needs a device check (task #10); `complement()` is TRAP-fenced.
